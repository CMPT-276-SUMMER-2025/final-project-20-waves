Project Title: GitHired

Group Members: Andrew Fassler, Eric Kim, Aaron Sutanto, Alexis Yew

Brief Description: A job site designed specifically to help software practitioners connect with the right companies and support them in seeking and securing employment.

Local Host Steps:
 1. Here is a list of dependencies the application needs to through local host.
    Important/Essential: @google/generative-ai"
             react-router-dom@google/generative-ai
             dotenv
             react-router-dom@types/react-dom
             typescript
             autoprefixer
    Non-Important:
             tailwindcss
             postcss

2. Next, add the .env file to ./githired (should be included in submission). This file contains the API keys
3. Next, you want to open a new terminal. I recommend using VSCode built in Terminal for organization.
4. In the new terminal navigate to "./githired" and run "node server.js"
5. In the first terminal, navigate to "./githired" and type "npm run dev"
6. The project should run, but the features don't work on local host, as the APIs route to the deployed website instead. 
 Everything except for Jobsearch and Cover Letter Helper should be functional.
